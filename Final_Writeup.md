## 1 Introduction<a name="1"></a>

With all of the 3C (Chromosome Conformation Capture) technologies, the underlying goal of Hi-C is to understand the physical structure of the genome by identifying the interactions between chromosomes. Hi-C exists as a novel method with several key features compared to the previous technologies:

**Genome-Wide** - Hi-C can probe the interaction profiles of all loci versus all other loci across the entire genome, and this feature is called "all vs. all".  

**High Throughput** - The Hi-C technology is high throughput, meaning that it can generate billions of reads per run with the help of next-generation sequencing.  


> In the next section, we will explore the experimental protocol as well as some Hi-C derived techniques.

## 2 Experimental Protocol<a name="2"></a>

The general Hi-C technique is as follows:

1. **Crosslinking** - Cells are cross-linked and fixed using formaldehyde so that spatially adjacent DNA are covalently bonded.
2. **Digestion** - Restriction enzymes are used to digest the DNA, leaving 5' overhangs.
3. **Biotinylation** - Fragment overhangs are filled and marked with biotin.
4. **Ligation** - The biotinylated ends are ligated together.
5. **Size Selection** - The ligated fragments are filtered, sheared, and purified via sonication to a desired sequence length for sequencing.  

To better illustrate the experimental workflow, below is a diagram:

## 3 Tools<a name="3"></a>
Hi-C is the highest through-put version of 3C-derived technologies. Due to the decreasing cost of 2nd generation sequencing, hi-c is widely used.

The principle of Hi-C can be illustrated as:

##### Hi-C critical steps [8] 
- Fixation: keep DNA conformed
- Digestion: enzyme frequency and penetratin
- Fill-in: biotin for junction enrichment
- Ligation: freeze interactions in sequence
- Biotin removal: junctions only
- Fragment size: small fragments sequence better
- Adapter ligation: paired-end and indexing
- PCR: create enough material for flow cell

## 4 Analysis<a name="4"></a> 
ChIA-PET is another method that combines ChIP and pair-end sequencing to analysis the chromtin interaction. It allows for targeted binding factors such as: estrogen receptor alpha, CTCF-mediated loops, RNA polymerase II, and a combination of key architectural factors. on the one hand, it has the benefit of achieving a higher resolution compared to Hi-C, as only ligation products involving the immunoprecipitated molecule are sequenced, on the other hand, ChIA-PET has systematic biases due to ChIP process:
- Only one type of binding factor selected
- Different antibodies
- ChIP conditions
