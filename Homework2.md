## Lecture 5. Introduction to Machine Learning

## Question 2 (15 points)

### a. Describe how in general clustering algorithms works. Explain the general idea starting from data points to a dendrogram. (5 pts)

### b. What are the differences between hierarchical and k-means clustering algorithm? (10 pts)

## Lecture 6. ChIP-seq

## Question 3 (40 points)

### a. Describe how ChIP-seq works. (10 pts)

### b. Two genes A and B are quantified by RNA-seq in two different experiments. For gene A, there are a total of 20,000,000 reads and 200 reads are within A. For gene B, there are a total of 10,000,000 reads and 10,000 reads are within B. The length of A and B are 7,000bp and 10,000bp respectively. Calculate the reads per kilobase million (RPKM) for gene A and B. (15pts) 

## Question 4 (15 points)

### You have a transcription factor (TF) with some binding motif. I.e: Suppose that given this motif you have an algorithm that can tell you whether or not your TF will bind some DNA of length 18. You also have a segment of DNA (oligo_x) that this algorithm tells you will be bound. Outline how you could determine whether or not this TF binding your oligo_x is statistically significant.

### b. Describe the experimental procedures of Hi-C. (15 pts)

### c. Explain the role of contact matrix in Hi-C data analysis? (10 pts)

### d. Describe the two physical models on genome folding. (10 pts)
