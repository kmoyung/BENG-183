### Question 1 (15 points)

**a. Describe how polymerase chain reaction (PCR) works. (5 pts)**

PCR is an in vitro version of DNA replication that aims to amplify a specified fragment of DNA. For PCR to happen, it requires key enzymes. DNA polymerase helps elongate the new DNA strand by adding nucleotides, DNA ligase joins the lagging strand fragments, Primase creates a primer for replication, Helicase untwists the DNA into single strands, Topoisomerase relieves the stress of the twisting of DNA, and Single strand binding protein stabilizes the unpaired single strands of DNA. Along with these key enzymes, PCR is done using a thermocycler that alters the temperature, allowing for the amplification to occur: step 1 denatures the DNA by increasing the temperature to 95 C, step 2 anneals the primers to the single strands of DNA at 40 - 65 C, and step 3 elongates the DNA sequence by adding nucleotides at 72 C towards the 3' end. 

**b. Describe how microarrays work. (5 pts)**

**c. Why is the central dogma incorrect/incomplete nowadays (5 pts)**

### Question 2 (15 points)

**a. Describe how Sanger sequencing works. (10 pts)**

Sanger sequencing was the first commercialized method of sequencing DNA. It utilizes PCR, or in-vitro DNA replication, to add modified nucleotides called ddNTPs in order to create truncated and fragmented DNA strands. These fragmented sequences, which come in various sizes depending on where the replication was terminated, are then run on a PAGE gel, which separates the mix of sequences by read length. Each base (A, T, C, G) is run separately in each lane of a gel. In the end, a scientist can read the gel to determine the actual sequence of As, Ts, Cs, or Gs in order by size of the sequence, from shortest to longest. Later, scientists were able to fluorescently label these nucleotides for a more automated sequencing innovation.

**b. What does the role of ddNTP play in Sanger sequencing? (5 pts)**

ddNTPs, or dideoxynucleotides, are engineered nucleotides that do not contain the 3'-hydroxyl that exist in typical dNTPs for DNA replication. The lack of this hydroxyl group prevents additional nucleotides to be added to the 3' end during elongation, effectively terminating that chain and ensuring that the ddNTP is the last nucleotide on the 3' end of that particular sequence. This forms the ingenuity behind the Sanger sequencing techinque, which takes advantage of these varied sequence lengths.

### Question 3 (10 points)

**a. Describe how Illumina's sequencing works. (10 pts)**

TODO

### Question 4 (10 points)

**a. Draw the typical structure of coding genes. (5 pts)**

5' UTR -- Exon 1 -- Intron 1 -- Exon 2 -- Intron 2 -- Exon 3 -- Intron 3 -- Exon 4 - 3' UTR

**b. Apart from coding genes, what are other annotated elements in the genome? (5 pts)**

Other annotated elements include: regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers, non-coding RNA such as miRNAs, tRNAs, rRNAs, lincRNAs, and repeat sequences along the genome.
